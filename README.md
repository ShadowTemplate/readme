# About me

Hi! My name is Gianvito and I am a curious, passionate, sturdy computer 
scientist from [Bari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari) (Italy), always 
looking for thrilling problems to solve.

This page will provide you some information about me, my projects and the 
things I love.
If you are interested in my academic background and my work experience you can 
have a look at my [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/readme/blob/master/Curriculum%20Vitae%20-%20Gianvito%20Taneburgo.pdf).
You can also find my contacts there. 
Feel free to send me an email (taneburgo_at_gmail_dot_com) for any question: 
I will be more than happy to reply!

I'm interested in deep learning, distributed systems and algorithms, cloud 
computing and concurrency. My most interesting GitHub projects cover these 
topics. In the future I'd love to have the possibility to also delve into other 
fields, such as algebra and statistics, computability and computational 
complexity.
Above all, quantum computing is polarizing my curiosity these days.

I see myself as a computer scientist more than a software engineer, since I 
love analysing and solving complex problems from a theoretical point of view, 
in front of a whiteboard, rather than just building software. 
However, I also like the practical part of my profession and few things in the 
world can give me satisfaction like an expressive, clean, elegant code does.
I believe coding is an art involving a unique form of creativity.
For this reason I always strive to implement algorithms in the best way I can 
and to develop robust, efficient and maintainable software.
I really like studying new paradigms, languages, design patterns, libraries and 
tools and I've become acquainted with the practical aspects of development, 
such as those involving testing, optimization, scalability and profiling.

## About my projects

In my GitHub profile you will find repositories for most of the code I've 
written in my life, from 
[my first Hello World in C](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/programming-1.0/blob/master/Esercitazione%201/Esercizio%201.c)
up to my master's degree machine learning thesis on 
[Constrained Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/constrained-adversarial-networks), 
a deep generative model.

I've created a simple [README template](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/project-template)
to keep project information organised.
Most of my projects conform to this template and you should be able to easily
retrieve the most important details for any of them.

They include programs written in Python, Java, C++, C, Scilab, JavaScript, 
HTML and CSS, using a wide variety of 
libraries (TensorFlow, NumPy, SciPy, Akka, Spark, scikit-learn, SimPy, Lombok, 
Numba, Selenium), 
platforms (Google Cloud Platform, Heroku)
and technologies (Hadoop, Java EE, git, Ant, Maven, WSDL, stem). 

If you wish to have a quick idea on my coding skills, you can have a look at 
one of these projects:

* [constrained-adversarial-networks](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/constrained-adversarial-networks)

*A deep generative model to instil prior knowledge on discrete domains in the 
form of constraints into Boundary-seeking Generative Adversarial Networks.
This repository contains both the TensorFlow model and the testing suite to 
generate data sets, run experiments, train Constrained Adversarial Networks and 
collect results.*

* [krafters](https://github.com/GianlucaBortoli/krafters)

*A black-box testing platform for message-based distributed algorithms. 
This tool provides a handy way to deploy a distributed environment, execute a 
distributed algorithm, orchestrate a series of tests and visualize the results. 
The environment can be either pseudo-distributed or fully-distributed on Google 
Compute Engine.
Distributed algorithms must rely on message passing and tests are performed by 
modifying the underlying network to introduce packet 
delay/loss/corruption/inversion via netem, a low-level Linux kernel tool.*

* [concurrent-set](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/concurrent-set)

*A collection of elegant Java 8 implementations of linked-list-based concurrent 
set.
The algorithms are described in the book The Art of Multiprocessor Programming 
by Maurice Herlihy and Nir Shavit.*

* [risakka](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/risakka)

*A didactic implementation of Raft consensus algorithm in Akka.*

You may be surprised at not finding appropriate tests for the code.
If this is the case, either you've forgotten your good old university days or 
you have had very good mentors.
Honestly, I've learnt the true importance of testing only while working for 
companies.
I once had a discussion about testing my thesis code with my co-supervisor.
He told me: "*Experiments are your tests*".
So, the absence of proper testing is just one compromise I've been forced to 
accept to respect deadlines. It was hard, but necessary.
Sorry, TDD guys.
I hope things will be different in the future.

## Beyond my projects

Some of you may be interested in finding out something about me not strictly 
related to computer science.
This is the right place and I'm happy you are reading this paragraph because I
consider myself a programmer with a human face, as in the 
[wonderful story of little printf](https://ferd.ca/the-little-printf.html).

In my spare time I try to cultivate my hobbies: reading manga and comics, 
building LEGO sets, running and playing Magic or other board games.
I also like experimenting new things and I'm always open to new adventures and 
experiences. In general, I like being pushed outside my comfort zone and 
being challenged. This is one reason for running 
[OPPY](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY) (One Project Per Year), my 
meta-project started in 2014: every year I try to complete at least one 
personal project to add some value to my life.

*Ad maiora!*
